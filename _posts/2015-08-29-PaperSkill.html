<h2 class="art-title">Tolerance Design</h2>
<h3 class="art-title">Begin</h3>
1.	The design of the entire manufacturing process of a product –and more particularly the assembly process – has a key impact on the performance of an industrial company.<br><br>
2.	Manufacturing imprecisions and measurement uncertainties lead to observable geometric deviations, which decrease the function and quality of mechanical products and have thus to be limited by geometric tolerances.<br><br>
3.	The objective of tolerance analysis is to check the feasibility and quality of assemblies or parts for a given GD&T scheme.<br><br>
4.	Manufacturing tolerances serve to satisfy not only the functional requirements given in the product definition model, but also the manufacturing constraints, such as machine accuracy and minimum extra machining thickness.<br><br>
<h3 class="art-title">Content</h3>
1.	The application of GDT for mechanical design has <strong>gained widespread acceptance </strong>in industry.<br><br>
2.	Geometrical tolerancing allows the designers to specify the maximum available tolerance and <strong>consequently (从而)</strong> design the most economical parts.<br><br>
3.	A properly tolerance drawing is not only a picture that communicates the size and shape of the part, but it also explains the tolerance relationships between features.<br><br>
4.	In this paper, angularity <strong>is taken for</strong> study.<br><br>
5.	As shown in Fig. 1.<br><br>
6.	Tolerance stack ups of individual components and their assembly have been <strong>carried out (开展)</strong> using graphical approach.<br><br>
7.	Many efforts have been <strong>made to</strong> develop assisting solution for assembly process planning.<br><br>
8.	Several methods have been<strong> proposed in (提出)</strong> the literature to evaluate (direct problem) or to optimize (inverse problem) assembly process plans.<br><br>
9.	But these methods are generally <strong>limited to</strong> a single aspect of the general problem – such as sequence planning or tolerancing – and a single performance indicator.<br><br>
10.	This paper aims at proposing an original method to select assembly techniques and to <strong>allocate</strong> geometrical tolerances on components by solving a multi-objective optimization problem to <strong>minimize cost and maximize quality.</strong><br><br>
11.	Extensive (大量的) work has been <strong>conducted (进行)</strong> to assist the generation of assembly sequences.<br><br>
12.	However, very few issues about assembly technique selection <strong>are addressed.(得到解决)</strong><br><br>
13.	The aim of this paper is to propose a method to select an assembly technique for each joint of a product and to allocate geometrical tolerances accordingly.<br><br>
14.	Research works <strong>assert (断言)</strong> that the tolerance stack-up has an impact on the F.E results[1] and the assembly process[2] as the case of the sheet metal assembly[3].<br><br>
15.	In our previous work, a method <strong>taking into account</strong> the tolerances <strong>on (考虑)</strong> CAD model was <strong>established</strong> [4] <strong>(已发表).</strong><br><br>
16.	In the past, various mathematical approaches for the representation of geometric tolerances in tolerance simulation models have been <strong>proposed.</strong><br><br>
17.	The objective of tolerance analysis is to check the feasibility and quality of assemblies or parts for a given GD&T scheme.<br><br>
18.	<strong>A large amount of fundamental research</strong> efforts has been given to explore the mathematical basis for tolerance analysis.<br><br>
19.	It is very important to avoid warranty returns and manage the rate of out-of-tolerance products in production that can lead to assembly line stoppages and/or wastage of out-of-tolerance mechanisms.<br><br>
20.	The approach proposed here <strong>focuses on</strong> adjusting the dimensions of the inner components rather than trying to reduce the impact of the sources of variation.<br><br>
21.	This model <strong>fills a research gap</strong> <strong>(填补了研究空白)</strong> as it holds a relational focus on how actors, tools, and communication flow in collaborative design between the different main activities in PD.<br><br>
22.	<strong>When it comes to (当涉及到)</strong> mechanical structures composed of a high number of components, like aeronautical structures, choices made for the assembly process account for a large share in the total delivery cost and geometrical quality of the assembled products.<br><br>
23.	Manufacturing imprecisions and measurement uncertainties <strong>lead to</strong> <strong>(导致)</strong> observable geometric deviations, which decrease the function and quality of mechanical products and have thus to be limited by geometric tolerances.<br><br>
24.	Various numerical methods <strong>were employed to (被用来) </strong>deal with complicated computations associated with tolerance design models.<br><br>
25.	A substantial amount of research has been <strong>carried out regarding</strong> optimal tolerance allocation using cost- -tolerance functions.<br><br>
26.	<strong>Despite</strong> numerous studies have been conducted in tolerancing during the last decades and many scientific progresses have been achieved, the problem is still far from solved, typically regarding three-dimensional manufacturing tolerancing.(用于总结的开始)<br><br>
27.	<strong>Making trades-off</strong> <strong>(作权衡)</strong> between automated and manual assembly plans proved to be very complex.<br><br>

<h3 class="art-title">Introduction conclude</h3>
1.	The second section details the data structure used to define a parametric assembly plan, what is required to tackle its optimization. The multi-objective optimization set to solve the problem addressed in this paper is described in the third section.<br><br>
2.	The entire method is illustrated through a simple case study presented in Section 6 where results are exposed and discussed. It is followed by a conclusion.

<h2 class="art-title">FSW</h2>
This paper <strong>study on</strong> the difference effect of tool forces cause by different tool pin. The threaded cylindrical pin is best for FSW.<br><br>
Most of the literature on FSW <strong>focuses on</strong> aluminum alloys; however, recently <strong>interest has grown in</strong> applying this technique to the joining of thermoplastic materials.<br><br>
This paper <strong>addresses this gap (弥补差距)</strong> of a study on the effects of process parameters.<br><br>
In the paper a new fixture for FSW of Ti-alloys was <strong>proposed(建议)</strong> and the results of experiments were presented.<br><br>
In the recent years few attempts were<strong> carried out(开展)</strong> to develop FSW process aimed to <strong>maximize</strong> the mechanical performances of the welded parts.<br><br>
Bakavos and Prangnell (2009) <strong>investigated</strong> the effect of pin length on the lap shear strength of FSSW welds produced in a 0.91 mm aluminum sheet.<br><br>
Bakavos et al. (2011) first <strong>demonstrated (展示)</strong> the material flow was strongly influenced by surface features of the shoulder.<br><br>
Tozaki et al. (2010) also <strong>performed</strong> <strong>(完成)</strong>FSSW using the scroll tool, and showed that it can produce high strength welds in a 2 mm thick sheet, although a depth of penetration greater than 0.5 mm was required.<br><br>
The strength of welds in FSSW is mainly influenced by material flow and heat generation between the tool/workpiece interfaces, as <strong>reported</strong> by Mishra and Ma (2005).<br><br>
Chao and Qi (1998) <strong>established</strong> a method to estimate heat generation.<br><br>
It has also been <strong>shown</strong> in Bhushan (1999) that the friction coefficient of Al on mild steel is in the range of 0.5–0.6, but the friction coefficient of Al self-mated pair is in the range of 0.8–1.2.<br><br>
The analysis was <strong>conducted on (实施了)</strong> the welded surfaces instead of the section (Zucchi et al., 2001) taking into account that the surface is the part more exposed to the environment.<br><br>
In recent years, the application of FSW has been <strong>a research focus.<br><br>
Despite(尽管) </strong>the widespread growth of FSW as a commercial joining process, the development and evolution of the microstructure at welded joint, the relationship between microstructure and properties of joint is not well understood.<br><br>
FSW is a solid-state welding process that has been <strong>proven</strong> to be very effective for joining of some metallic materials such as aluminums, copper, and magnesium alloys.<br><br>
<strong>In contrast to</strong> fusion welding techniques, FSW results in a much lower distortion, no welding arc, a lower weld finishing costs, and the lower residual stresses associated with a low heat input of the processing.<br><br>
While the research and applications of FSW have mainly focused on the aluminum alloys, <strong>investigations</strong> into the FSW of copper and copper alloys are quite limited.<br><br>
They <strong>reported</strong> the grain size of the stirred zone (SZ) decreased from 9 to 3.5 lm with decreasing rotation rate from 800 to 400 rpm at constant traverse speed of 50 mm/min.<br><br>
They <strong>indicated</strong> that variations of both micro hardness and yield strength of the SZ are related to grain size with the Hall–Petch relationship.<br><br>
Alternatively, Aota and Ikeuchi (2010) <strong>performed</strong> FSSW using a dome-shaped tool without a pin, and <strong>reported</strong> that the depth of the material flow was less than 0.5mm.<br><br>
A number of studies have been <strong>conducted</strong> <strong>to</strong> evaluate the feasibility of FSW of magnesium alloys.<br><br>
<strong>One concern with</strong> this reasoning is that, in such series of welds it is not only the tool rpm that is varied<br><br>
<strong>In the published literature</strong> the effects of forge force have not <strong>received</strong> as much attention as tool rotation and welding speed effects.<br><br>
<strong>At about same time</strong> Record et al. reported a design of experiment based approach where nine welding parameters were used.<br><br>
<strong>As the application of</strong> friction stir welding widens it will be important to understand the behavior of process variables.<br><br>
This understanding will be <strong>helpful in</strong> a variety of scenarios.<br><br>
Bautista et al. (2010) <strong>stated</strong> that the intrinsic electrical conductivity also depends significantly on the mechanical strain.<br><br>
Hardness measurements are usually <strong>performed</strong> <strong>to</strong> evaluate the hardness field of a joint, directly correlated with the microstructure produced during Friction Stir Welding (FSW) as<strong> shown by</strong> Barcellona et al. (2006).<br><br>
In aluminum alloys a large variety of<strong> </strong>second phases and precipitates is <strong>observed</strong> depending on the chemical composition of major alloying elements and the time to form complete or incomplete stoichiometric precipitates (Mishra and Ma, 2005).<br><br>
Lakshminarayanan and Balasubramanian (2008) <strong>quantified (量化)</strong> the contribution on UTS of rotational speed, feed rate and axial force on welded specimens of a ZnMgAl alloy, applying the statistical Taguchi method for process parameters optimization.<br><br>
Ericsson and Sandstrom (2003) <strong>emphasized (强调)</strong> the relevance of fatigue behavior of FSW joints for aircraft and automotive appli-cations.<br><br>
In the last few years many efforts were <strong>carried out</strong> to investigate the fatigue properties of friction stir welded joints and how they can be related with welding process.<br><br>
James et al. (2003) <strong>deeply analyzed</strong> the influences of process parameters, welding defects and residual stress on the fatigue behavior.<br><br>
Shusheng et al. (2006) <strong>referred (提到)</strong> a ‘zigzag-curve’ defects that can occur over the whole section of the stir zone, even if optimized welding parameters are employed.<br><br>
Cirello et al. (2006) <strong>examined</strong> the influence of relevant FSW process parameters, i.e. the tool rotating speed, the feed rate and the tool sinking into the samples, on the fatigue resistance of AA6082-T6 butt joints.<br><br>
Feng et al. (2010) <strong>observed</strong> the effects of the welding parameters on the LCF behavior and microstructure evolution of friction stir welded 6061Al-T651 alloy.<br><br>
The influence of FSW on the fatigue life of Al6063-T6 notched samples <strong>was investigated in </strong>Moreira et al. (2008).<br><br>
<strong>In the present work</strong>, an analytical model for heat generation for taper cylindrical (TC) pin profile in FSW was developed.<br><br>
Khandkar et al. <strong>introduced</strong> a torque based heat input model for SC pin profile.<br><br>
Gadakh and Kumar have<strong> made an attempt to develop</strong> an analytical model for heat generation for TC pin profile but they have modeled it incorrectly.<br><br>
Suresha et al. <strong>reveals (揭示)</strong> that the conical tools show better joint efficiency compared to the square tools.<br><br>
<strong>According to</strong> Liu and Zhang, for a fusion welding process model, the welding distortion decreases with increasing restraining force.<br><br>
FSP has been successfully <strong>employed in</strong> several aluminum alloys to confer or enhance superplasticity.

1.	The inverse problem displayed in Fig.1 is <strong>solved</strong> thanks to a multi-objective optimization.<br><br>
2.	In order to provide a clear representation of the sequence, both approaches are <strong>combined</strong> in an Assembly Sequence Graph. An example is <strong>displayed</strong> in Fig. 3.<br><br>
